I recently gave a talk at CinciJS about some of the things I've learned in the year I've been working with Meteor.js.

Some of the topics I talked about include:

* Atmosphere
* Meteor NPM package integration
* Package namespacing
* Why javascript being everywhere is important
* Why Meteor.js is more than a framework, it's a platform
* [Testing with Meteor.js](http://testingmeteor.com)
