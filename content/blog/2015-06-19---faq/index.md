## Great blog, what else do you do?

You can find me on [Youtube](http://youtube.com/queso98), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshowens), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/joshuajowens). I also run two meteor podcasts ([Meteor Podcast](http://meteorpodcast.com), [Meteor Club Podcast](http://podcast.meteorjs.club)), a [club for Meteor.js lovers](https://meteorjs.club), & give various training things like [Mastering Meteor](https://meteorjs.club/learn) and [8 days of Meteor](https://meteorjs.club/8days). Oh and I run the [Meteor.js news site, Crater](https://crater.io/).

## Do you consult or do private training?

Yes, I do consulting and private training. I also do code reviews. Reach out to me on twitter or Joshua.Owens AT gmail. I am also available for [Meteor Consulting on airpair](https://www.airpair.com/book/joshowens) or [doing code reviews](http://spacedojo.com).
